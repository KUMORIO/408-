>Think about driving a route that's very familiar. It could be your commute to work, a trip into town or the way home. Whichever it is, you know every twist and turn like the back of your hand. On these sorts of trips it's easy to lose concentration on the driving and pay little attention to the passing scenery. The consequence is that you perceive that the trip has taken less time than it actually has.
>This is the well-travelled road effect: People tend to underestimate the time it takes to travel a familiar route.
>The effect is caused by the way we allocate our attention. When we travel down a well-known route, because we don't have to concentrate much, time seems to flow more quickly. And afterwards, when we come to think back on it, we can't remember the journey well because we didn't pay much attention to it. So we assume it was shorter.

>想象一下，开车走一条非常熟悉的路线。可能是你上班的通勤路线，去城里的路，或者回家的路。不管是哪条路，你都对每一个弯道非常熟悉。这种情况下，很容易失去对驾驶的专注力，对沿途的景色也不太注意。结果是，你会感觉这段旅程花费的时间比实际要短。这就是熟路效应：人们往往低估走一条熟悉路线所需的时间。
>
>这种效应是由我们分配注意力的方式引起的。当我们走一条熟悉的路线时，因为不需要太多的注意力，时间似乎流逝得更快。而事后，当我们回想起这段旅程时，由于没有认真关注它，我们记不太清楚。所以我们就认为这段旅程比较短。

>The supermarket is designed to lure customers into spending as much time as possible within its doors. The reason for this is simple: The longer you stay in the store, the more stuff you'll see, and the more stuff you see, the more you911 buy. And supermarkets contain a lot of stuff. The average supermarket, according to the Food Marketing Institute, carries some 44,000 different items, and many carry tens of thousands more. The sheer volume of available choice is enough to send shoppers into a state of information overload. According to brainscan experiments, the demands of so much decision-making quickly become too much for us. After about 40 minutes of shopping, most people stop struggling to be rationally selective, and instead begin shopping emotionally—which is the point at which we accumulate the 50 percent of stuff in our cart that we never intended buying.

>超市的设计目的是吸引顾客尽可能长时间地待在店内。原因很简单：你在店内待的时间越长，你看到的东西就越多，而你看到的东西越多，你就会买得越多。超市里有很多东西。据食品营销研究所统计，普通超市大约有44,000种不同的商品，许多超市有数万种以上的商品。可供选择的庞大数量足以让购物者感到信息过载。根据脑扫描实验，大量的决策需求很快会让我们不堪重负。购物大约40分钟后，大多数人会停止理性选择，而开始感性购物——这时我们购物车里50%的东西都是我们原本没打算买的。

>My dream has always been to work somewhere in an area between fashion and publishing. Two years before graduating from secondary school, I took a sewing and design course thinking that I would move on to a fashion design course. However, during that course I realised I was not good enough in this area to compete with other creative personalities in the future, so I decided that it was not the right path for me. Before applying for university I told everyone that I would study journalism, because writing was, and still is, one of my favourite activities. But, to be honest, I said it, because I thought that fashion and me together was just a dream—I knew that no one could imagine me in the fashion industry at all! So I decided to look for some fashion-related courses that included writing. This is when I noticed the course u Fashion Media & Promotion. ”

>我的梦想一直是在时尚和出版之间的某个领域工作。在中学毕业前两年，我参加了一门缝纫和设计课程，想着以后能继续上时尚设计课程。然而，在那门课期间，我意识到自己在这个领域不够优秀，无法在未来与其他有创造力的人竞争，所以我决定这条路不适合我。在申请大学之前，我告诉所有人我会学习新闻学，因为写作曾经是，而且现在仍然是我最喜欢的活动之一。但说实话，我这么说是因为我认为时尚和我在一起只是一个梦想——我知道没有人能想象我会在时尚行业里！于是我决定寻找一些与时尚相关且包含写作的课程。这时，我注意到了“时尚媒体与推广”课程。

>It is easy to underestimate English writer James Herriot. He had such a pleasant, readable style that one might think that anyone could imitate it. How many times have I heard people say, “I could write a book. I just haven't the time. " Easily said. Not so easily done. James Herriot, contrary to popular opinion, did not find it easy in his early days of, as he put it, uhaving a go at the writing game”. While he obviously had an abundance of natural talent, the final, polished work that he gave to the world was the result of years of practising, re-writing and reading. Like the majority of authors, he had to suffer many disappointments and rejections along the way, but these made him all the more determined to succeed. Everything he achieved in life was earned the hard way and his success in the literary field was no exception.
