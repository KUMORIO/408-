>It is easy to underestimate English writer James Herriot. He had such a pleasant, readable style that one might think that anyone could imitate it. How many times have I heard people say, “I could write a book. I just haven't the time. " Easily said. Not so easily done. James Herriot, contrary to popular opinion, did not find it easy in his early days of, as he put it, uhaving a go at the writing game”. While he obviously had an abundance of natural talent, the final, polished work that he gave to the world was the result of years of practising, re-writing and reading. Like the majority of authors, he had to suffer many disappointments and rejections along the way, but these made him all the more determined to succeed. Everything he achieved in life was earned the hard way and his success in the literary field was no exception.

>很容易低估英国作家詹姆斯·赫里欧特。他有一种令人愉快且易读的写作风格，这让人们可能认为任何人都可以模仿他。我听过多少次人们说：“我可以写一本书。我只是没有时间。”说起来容易，做起来难。与普遍看法相反，詹姆斯·赫里欧特在他早期尝试写作时并不轻松。尽管他显然有着丰富的天赋，但他最终呈现给世界的精致作品是经过多年练习、重写和阅读的结果。像大多数作家一样，他在这个过程中经历了许多失望和拒绝，但这些反而使他更坚定地要成功。他在生活中所取得的一切成就都是通过艰苦努力得来的，他在文学领域的成功也不例外。
