>人们现在越来越意识到“外貌焦虑”或过度关注自身外貌的危险。在当今社会，受社交媒体和广泛广告的推动，遵循某些美丽标准的压力加剧了。这种痴迷可能导致严重的心理健康问题，如抑郁、低自尊和饮食失调。	
>
>​	People are now increasingly aware of the danger of "appearance anxiety" or being obsessed with one’s looks. In today’s society, driven by social media and **pervasive** advertising, the pressure to conform to certain beauty standards has **intensified**. This obsession can lead to severe mental health issues, such as depression, low self-esteem, and eating disorders.
>
>Instagram和TikTok等平台的兴起**加剧**了这一问题。不断接触经过大量编辑和精心策划的图片，创造了不现实的美丽标准。许多人努力模仿这些标准，往往以心理健康为代价，这在越来越多的年轻人寻求整容手术或依赖滤镜来改变外貌中可见一斑。
>
>​	The rise of platforms like Instagram and TikTok has **magnified** this issue. Constant exposure to heavily edited and **curated** images creates an unrealistic standard of beauty. Many strive to **emulate** these standards, often to the **detriment** of their mental well-being, seen in the growing number of young individuals seeking **cosmetic** surgery or relying on filters to alter their appearance.

For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write an essay commenting on the remark “Earth provides  enough to satisfy every man’s need, but not every man’s greed.” You can cite examples to illustrate your  point. You should write at least 150 words but no more than 200 words .

>这句话“地球能满足每个人的需要，但无法满足每个人的贪婪”强调了我们与环境关系中的一个关键问题。地球提供了丰富的资源，足以满足所有人的需求，如果我们明智地使用这些资源。然而，人类的贪婪常常导致过度开发，造成严重的环境和社会问题。
>
>The remark "Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's need, but not every man's greed" **underscores** a key issue in our relationship with the environment. The Earth offers abundant resources sufficient for all if used wisely. However, human greed often leads to overexploitation, causing significant environmental and social problems.
>
>砍伐森林就是一个典型的例子。森林提供木材、食物和药材，同时维持生态平衡。然而，大规模的商业伐木导致森林破坏，破坏了生态系统，并加剧了气候变化。同样，由于商业利益驱动的过度捕捞，使海洋资源枯竭，威胁海洋生物多样性，并影响依赖渔业的社区。
>
>**Deforestation** is a prime example. Forests provide timber, food, and medicines while maintaining ecological balance. Yet, large-scale logging for profit leads to deforestation, disrupting ecosystems and contributing to climate change. Similarly, overfishing driven by commercial greed **depletes** ocean **stocks**, endangering marine **biodiversity** and affecting communities reliant on fishing.
>
>过度消费化石燃料以获取能源，由于经济利益驱动，导致了环境退化，包括空气污染和全球变暖。太阳能和风能等可再生能源可以在不伤害地球的情况下满足我们的能源需求，但由于化石燃料行业的既得利益，转型进展缓慢。
>
>Excessive fossil fuel consumption for energy, driven by economic gain, results in environmental degradation, including air pollution and global warming. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind could meet our needs without harming the planet, but the **transition** is slow due to vested interests in fossil fuels.

>总之，地球能够满足人类的需求，但不受控制的贪婪破坏了这种平衡，导致环境破坏。可持续的做法和公平的资源利用对于确保地球能够支持所有居民至关重要。

>人们现在越来越意识到，在面对太多选择时做出决定的挑战。这种现象通常被称为“选择过多”，会导致焦虑和犹豫。例如，超市里种类繁多的商品虽然承诺了自由，但也会让消费者在相似的产品中难以抉择，造成压力。
>
>People are now increasingly aware of the challenges in making a decision when faced with too many choices. This phenomenon, often termed "choice overload," can lead to anxiety and indecision. For instance, while a supermarket's vast array of products promises freedom, it can also result in stress as consumers struggle to choose the best option among many similar ones.
>
>
>
>在我自己的经历中，购买新笔记本电脑就突显了这种困境。有几十种型号，功能相似但细节不同，选择的数量让我感到**不知所措**。相较于感到赋权，我却被压倒，无法分辨哪个选择最符合我的需求。最终，这导致我推迟购买，且对自己的决定更加不确定。

>In my own experience, shopping for a new laptop highlighted this dilemma. With dozens of models boasting similar features but differing in subtle ways, the **sheer** number of options left me **paralyzed**. Instead of feeling empowered, I was overwhelmed, unable to discern which choice best met my needs. Ultimately, this led me to delay my purchase and feel more uncertain about my decision.
>
>
>
>研究支持了这种体验。心理学家如巴里·施瓦茨的研究表明，过多的选择会减少满意度并增加后悔。当选项有限时，人们往往对自己的决定感到更满意。例如，餐厅简化的菜单可以提升顾客的满意度，因为决策过程变得不那么繁重。
>
>Studies support this experience. Research by psychologists like Barry Schwartz suggests that an abundance of choices can reduce satisfaction and increase regret. When options are limited, people tend to feel more content with their decisions. For example, a simplified menu in a restaurant can enhance customer satisfaction, as the decision-making process becomes less burdensome.

>因此，尽管多样性通常被视为有益，但越来越多的人认识到，过多的选择会使决策变得复杂。平衡自由和简化可能是减少现代消费主义相关压力的关键。

>
>One major factor contributing to this gap is the lack of digital literacy among the elderly. Unlike younger generations who grow up with technology, many seniors did not have the opportunity to learn these skills early on. This can lead to feelings of frustration and isolation, as they may find it hard to communicate with family and friends who rely heavily on digital platforms.
>
>此外，技术的快速演变意味着即使是那些拥有一些数字技能的老年人也可能难以跟上更新。例如，新软件更新、安全协议和新兴技术可能让人感到不堪重负。这不仅妨碍了他们访问必要服务，如在线银行和远程医疗，还影响了他们的整体生活质量。
>
>Moreover, the rapid evolution of technology means that even those elderly individuals who have some digital skills may struggle to stay updated. For instance, new software updates, security protocols, and emerging technologies can be overwhelming. This not only hinders their ability to access essential services, such as online banking and telehealth, but also affects their overall quality of life.
>
>为了弥合这一鸿沟，提供针对老年人的支持和教育至关重要。社区中心、图书馆和志愿者项目可以提供针对他们需求的数字素养课程。
>
>To bridge this gap, it is crucial to provide targeted support and education for the elderly. Community centers, libraries, and volunteer programs can offer digital literacy classes tailored to their needs.
