make comments, cite examples or use your personal experiences to develop your essay. You should -write at least
150 words but no more than 200 words

>
>

>
>People are now increasingly aware of the challenges in making a decision when faced with too many choices. This phenomenon, often termed "choice overload," can lead to anxiety and indecision. For instance, while a supermarket's vast array of products promises freedom, it can also result in stress as consumers struggle to choose the best option among many similar ones.
>
>
>
>在我自己的经历中，购买新笔记本电脑就突显了这种困境。有几十种型号，功能相似但细节不同，选择的数量让我感到**不知所措**。相较于感到赋权，我却被压倒，无法分辨哪个选择最符合我的需求。最终，这导致我推迟购买，且对自己的决定更加不确定。

>
>Studies support this experience. Research by psychologists like Barry Schwartz suggests that an abundance of choices can reduce satisfaction and increase regret. When options are limited, people tend to feel more content with their decisions. For example, a simplified menu in a restaurant can enhance customer satisfaction, as the decision-making process becomes less burdensome.
>

>因此，尽管多样性通常被视为有益，但越来越多的人认识到，过多的选择会使决策变得复杂。平衡自由和简化可能是减少现代消费主义相关压力的关键。
>
>Therefore, while variety is often seen as beneficial, there is a growing recognition that too many choices can complicate decision-making. Balancing freedom with simplicity might be key to reducing the stress associated with modern consumerism.
